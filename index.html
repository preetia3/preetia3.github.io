    <h1 class="center">Differences in Life Expectancy and GDP across Countries</h1>
  </div>

  <br>      
  <p>
    In this narrative visualization, we will explore and see changes in Life Expectancy (in years) and GDP per capita (in USD) for 
    different countries. <br><br>
    
    We will be able to visualize how Life Expectancy and GDP per capita varied across different countries in the world for 2015. We will 
    also do a deeper dive into how Life Expectancy has changed from 2000 to 2015 for a nation of interest to the author, India. Finally, 
    you will have the chance to explore the data further and see how these statistics compare from 2011 through 2015, for the top 5 most 
    populated countries in the world.
    <br><br>

    Before we go further, let's review the definition of these statistics:<br><br>
    1. <strong>Life Expectancy</strong>: According to the World Health Organization, Life Expectancy is the average number of years that a
    newborn could expect to live, if he or she were to pass through life exposed to the sex- and age-specific death rates prevailing at the
    time of his or her birth, for a specific year, in a given country, territory, or geographic area. <br><br>

    2. <strong> GDP per capita</strong>: The World Bank defines GDP per capita as the sum of gross value added by all resident producers 
    in the economy plus any product taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation of output, divided by mid-year population.

    1. <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/">Countries in the world by population (2023) </a>
    This data source provided the list of the top 5 most populated countries in the world, as of 2023.<br><br>
    2. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated">Life Expectancy (WHO)</a>This data source provided
    the core data used in this visualization. It provided the Life Expectancy and GDP per capita for 179 countries for the years 2000-2015.
